**Project Title: Employee Management System**

My project is titled **Employee Management System**, developed using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, and **REST APIs**.

It‚Äôs a **backend-focused web application** that allows organizations to manage employee data efficiently. 
   The core functionalities include **adding new employees, viewing records, updating details, and deleting employees**‚Äîall handled through RESTful APIs.

I used **Spring Boot** with **Spring Data JPA** to interact with the MySQL database, enabling smooth data operations and API communication. 
  The APIs were thoroughly tested using **Postman** to ensure proper functionality and error handling.

The application follows a **layered architecture** (Controller, Service, Repository), promoting modular code and scalability. 
    All employee data is securely stored and managed in a **MySQL** database.

Through this project, I gained practical experience in **API development**, **CRUD operations**, **database connectivity**, 
       and **real-world backend system design** using Spring Boot.

--- I hosted the code on GitHub and tested all APIs using Postman. 
This project helped me understand real-world backend development and database handling using Spring Boot.‚Äù

Optional (if they ask follow-up):

> ‚ÄúIf I had more time, I would add input validations, login authentication, and role-based access for better security.‚Äù

Challenges Faced During Project :

"What challenges did you face during your project?"

"Can you tell me a problem you faced while working on your project and how you solved it?"

"How did you handle errors or bugs during development?"

"What was the most difficult part of your project?"


One of the challenges I faced was a CORS error when testing my APIs through Postman or browser.
The frontend wasn't able to access my backend.

I researched and resolved it by adding the @CrossOrigin annotation in my Spring Boot controller, 
which allowed cross-origin requests.



Example
While working on my Employee Management System backend project, I was testing my REST APIs using Postman. But when I later tried to connect those APIs with a basic frontend setup, I got a CORS policy error ‚Äî the browser was blocking the request.

I resolved it by adding the @CrossOrigin(origins = "*") annotation to my Spring Boot controller. This allowed requests from different domains.

Explanation in Board 
Start with this intro:

‚ÄúThis is my Employee Management System, built using Spring Boot and MySQL. 
    It allows users to add, update, view, and delete employee records through RESTful APIs.‚Äù
---

üîπ Step-by-step flow to draw on the board and explain:

1. Draw 3 boxes ‚Äî label them:

Client (Postman or Frontend)  <---> Backend (Spring Boot App)  <----> Database (MySQL)

2. Explain the flow like this:

--->When the user sends a request, like adding an employee, the request first reaches the Controller in Spring Boot. 
       The Controller sends it to the Service layer, where business logic is handled. 
        From there, it goes to the Repository layer, which interacts with the MySQL database to save or fetch data.

üîπ Then mention the key features:

CRUD operations using REST APIs

Spring Data JPA for database operations

Exception handling for invalid inputs

Well-structured layers: Controller, Service, Repository

üîπ Wrap it up with confidence:

‚ÄúI hosted the code on GitHub and tested all APIs using Postman. This project helped me understand real-world backend development and database handling using Spring Boot.‚Äù
