**Project Title: Employee Management System**

My project is titled **Employee Management System**, developed using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, and **REST APIs**.

It‚Äôs a **backend-focused web application** that allows organizations to manage employee data efficiently. 
   The core functionalities include **adding new employees, viewing records, updating details, and deleting employees**‚Äîall handled through RESTful APIs.

I used **Spring Boot** with **Spring Data JPA** to interact with the MySQL database, enabling smooth data operations and API communication. 
  The APIs were thoroughly tested using **Postman** to ensure proper functionality and error handling.

    All employee data is securely stored and managed in a **MySQL** database.

Through this project, I gained practical experience in **API development**, **CRUD operations**, **database connectivity**, 
       and **real-world backend system design** using Spring Boot.

--- I hosted the code on GitHub and tested all APIs using Postman. 
This project helped me understand real-world backend development and database handling using Spring Boot.‚Äù

Challenges Faced During Project :

"What challenges did you face during your project?"

"Can you tell me a problem you faced while working on your project and how you solved it?"

"How did you handle errors or bugs during development?"

"What was the most difficult part of your project?"

Solution : 

‚ÄúWhile testing my Employee Management System in Postman. I got errors due to duplicate employee IDs. 
    I solved it by adding unique constraints in MySQL.‚Äù
// CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
              or 
‚ÄúI added a unique constraint in the Entity so Hibernate generated it in the database automatically. 
This ensures no duplicate entries are stored.‚Äù

Explanation in Board 
Start with this intro:

‚ÄúThis is my Employee Management System, built using Spring Boot and MySQL. 
    It allows users to add, update, view, and delete employee records through RESTful APIs.‚Äù
---

üîπ Step-by-step flow to draw on the board and explain:

1. Draw 3 boxes ‚Äî label them:

Client (Postman or Frontend)  <---> Backend (Spring Boot App)  <----> Database (MySQL)

2. Explain the flow like this:

--->When the user sends a request, like adding an employee, the request first reaches the Controller in Spring Boot. 
       The Controller sends it to the Service layer, where business logic is handled. 
        From there, it goes to the Repository layer, which interacts with the MySQL database to save or fetch data.

üîπ Then mention the key features:

CRUD operations using REST APIs

Spring Data JPA for database operations

Exception handling for invalid inputs

Well-structured layers: Controller, Service, Repository

üîπ Wrap it up with confidence:

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Questions (Spring Boot & Backend)**

**Q4. Why did you choose Spring Boot for this project?**
‚Üí Because Spring Boot makes backend development easy with built-in setup, auto-configuration, and an embedded server. It helps create REST APIs quickly with less code.

**Q5. What are REST APIs, and how did you use them?**
‚Üí REST APIs allow communication between client and server using HTTP methods.
In my project:

* `GET` ‚Äì to get employee details
* `POST` ‚Äì to add employee
* `PUT` ‚Äì to update employee
* `DELETE` ‚Äì to delete employee

**Q6. How does Spring Data JPA work in your project?**
‚Üí Spring Data JPA helps connect my application with the database. It allows CRUD operations without writing SQL manually.

**Q7. What is the difference between @Controller and @RestController?**
‚Üí `@Controller` returns web pages (views), but `@RestController` returns data in JSON format for APIs.

**Q8. How do you handle exceptions in your project?**
‚Üí I used `@ExceptionHandler` and `@ControllerAdvice` to handle errors and give proper error messages like ‚ÄúNot Found‚Äù or ‚ÄúBad Request‚Äù.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database & SQL Questions**

**Q9. What tables did you create in your database?**
‚Üí I created an **employee** table with fields ‚Äî id, name, email, department, and salary.

**Q10. How is the connection established between Spring Boot and MySQL?**
‚Üí I added MySQL details like URL, username, and password in the `application.properties` file. Spring Boot connects automatically using JPA.

**Q11. Did you write any custom queries?**
‚Üí Yes, I used the `@Query` annotation for some custom queries when needed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üß™ **API Testing & Deployment**

**Q12. How did you test your APIs?**
‚Üí I tested all the APIs using **Postman** by sending different requests and checking the responses.

**Q13. Did you deploy your project or host it anywhere?**
‚Üí I hosted my code on **GitHub** and tested the project locally using Spring Boot‚Äôs built-in Tomcat server.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üí° **Conceptual / Scenario-Based Questions**

**Q14. If multiple users access the same employee record, how would you handle concurrency?**
‚Üí I would use JPA‚Äôs **optimistic locking** or handle it using **database transactions**.

**Q15. How would you secure your REST APIs?**
‚Üí I can use **Spring Security** and **JWT tokens** to allow only authorized users to access the APIs.

**Q16. How can you improve this project in the future?**
‚Üí I can add login and role-based access, pagination, a frontend using React or Angular, and deploy it on cloud platforms like AWS.
